VIPER Logarithmic Moving Average Indicator

VIPER Logarithmic Moving Average Indicator
Overview
The VIPER Logarithmic Moving Average (LMA) is a custom TradingView indicator written in Pine Script (version 6). This indicator provides a logarithmic moving average of the selected price source (defaulting to close price) and visualizes multiple levels above and below this average, alongside an analysis of market bias based on the close price in relation to the LMA.

Features
Calculates a logarithmic moving average based on the specified price source.
Generates upper and lower levels relative to the LMA.
Displays bias information (indicating market sentiment) based on whether price is above or below the LMA.
Provides a table overlaying the chart with the LMA value and bias information.
Installation
Open TradingView and create a new script.
Copy and paste the provided code into the editor.
Save the script and add it to your chart.
Code Explanation
Constants and Input
pinescript
HOUR = (hour + 3.5) / 9  
SOURCE = input(close, title = 'Source')  
HOUR: Adjusts the current hour for log calculations.
SOURCE: Allows users to select which price to base the moving average on.
Logarithmic Moving Average Function
The key function in this script calculates the LMA:

pinescript
f_Logarithmic_Moving_Average(Source, Length) =>  
    ...  
This function iterates over a specified length, applying a logarithmic weight to each value, and computes the LMA.

Step Size and Levels Calculation
The script calculates step sizes and creates multiple upper and lower levels to visualize potential support and resistance areas in the market:

pinescript
STEP_SIZE = math.pow(open, int(1 / 5)) / 10  
LEVEL_1 = LMA + STEP_SIZE / HOUR  
...  
Line Drawing Logic
The script dynamically updates upper and lower lines based on the best available data:

pinescript
if barstate.islast  
    ...  
This block clears previous line levels and draws new levels only when the last bar on the chart is being processed, optimizing performance.

Bias Calculation
The bias is determined using the close price compared to the LMA:

pinescript
f_Calculate_Bias(ClosePrice, LMAValue) =>  
    ...  
Returns "UP" if the close price is less than the LMA and "DOWN" otherwise.
Displaying Results
A table displaying the LMA value and bias is rendered in the top right corner of the chart, enhancing usability:

pinescript
var table MY_TABLE = table.new(position.top_right, 11, 11)  
...  
Background color of the bias cell changes based on direction (green for "UP" and red for "DOWN").
Conclusion
The VIPER Logarithmic Moving Average script provides traders with a unique visualization tool to analyze trends and market conditions. By leveraging the logarithmic calculations, this indicator aims to effectively highlight price action relative to its moving average, which can inform trading strategies.

Feel free to customize the SOURCE input or tweak the levels and colors to suit your trading style!
